A young woman dressed in a light gray hoodie and black leggings is sitting on a wooden bench in a city park. Around her, there are green trees, a paved walking path, and a metal water bottle placed on the bench beside her. She is holding a closed book in her lap and looking ahead thoughtfully. The sky is clear with soft afternoon sunlight filtering through the leaves.
The woman opens the book and begins to read, her eyes scanning the pages.
The woman lifts the metal water bottle and takes a sip from it.
The woman closes the book and looks up, observing the park surroundings.
