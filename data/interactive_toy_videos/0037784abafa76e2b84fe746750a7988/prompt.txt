A young boy wearing a yellow t-shirt and denim shorts is in a backyard garden. A red ball, a blue watering can, and a green garden hose lie on the grass nearby. The boy is standing next to a flower bed filled with colorful flowers, holding the blue watering can in his right hand. The sun is shining brightly overhead.
The boy lifts the watering can and starts pouring water onto the flowers in the flower bed.
The boy sets the watering can down on the grass and picks up the red ball with both hands.
The boy throws the red ball forward into the garden while standing near the flower bed.
