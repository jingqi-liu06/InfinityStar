A young boy wearing a yellow t-shirt and denim shorts stands in a park next to a wooden bench. On the bench lies a red soccer ball and a blue backpack. Trees with green leaves surround the area, and sunlight filters through the branches. The boy looks at the soccer ball while holding the straps of his backpack.
The boy bends down and picks up the red soccer ball from the bench.
The boy holds the soccer ball with both hands and begins to bounce it on the ground.
The boy kicks the soccer ball forward, sending it rolling across the grass.
